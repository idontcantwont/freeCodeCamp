                The page that started it all came online almost 30 years ago.
                On August 6, 1991, the World Wide Web, in its entirety, was contained in one site that looked like this. More or less.
            </p>
            <p>
                Created by Tim Berners-Lee, it was hosted on a NeXT computer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN. You can still find a version of it at the <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html" id = "tribute-link" target = "_blank">same address</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Berners-Lee studied Physics at Oxford. While employed at CERN in the 1980s, he noted how tough it was to keep track of the projects and computer systems of the organization’s thousands of researchers, who were spread around the globe. So in March, 1989, he submitted a proposal for an information management system that used hypertext to link documents on different computers that were connected to the Internet.

            <p>
                Labelling it "vague but exciting," his boss gave a dubious green light to the project. Working with colleague Robert Cailliau, Berners-Lee went to work building what he would eventually come to call the WorldWideWeb (after trying out names like Information Management, and Information Mesh).
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of 1990, Berners-Lee had developed the key technologies that have become the bedrock of the Web, such as HTML, HTTP, URLs, and some basic web server and browser software.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Berners-Lee didn’t try to cash in on his invention, and rejected CERN’s call to patent his Web technology. He wanted the Web to be open and free so it could expand and evolve as rapidly as possible. As he later said,

                "Had the technology been proprietary, and in my total control, it would probably not have taken off. You can’t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.”
            </div>

            <p>
                In 1994, Berners-Lee left CERN for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an organization that maintains standards for the Web. The low-profile visionary went on to be named one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, and in 2004 was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. In 2009, Berners-Lee started the World Wide Web Foundation, an organization focused on ensuring the Web benefits humanity. During the opening ceremony at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, he was honored for inventing the Web and tweeted,
